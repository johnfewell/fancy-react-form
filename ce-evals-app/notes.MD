## Issues

- [-] make dashboard page for superadmin
- [ ] The evaluation answer page looks terrible
- [ ] Add some page for new users who aren't assigned yet, make it so they can't take many actions on the site
- [-] Make it so that you can't reassign evaluations once there are associated finished_evaluations. It's hidden on the view page, but you can still go to the edit path.
- [-] make it so you can't fill out an evaluation for the same course twice as the same user
- [-] Finish auth stuff
- [ ] Eliminate unneeded routes
